# Exercise: Use Cases and Diagrammatic Realizations

## Tasks

1. Write the missing code so that `Form1`  displays correct behavior for the
   number-guessing game.

2. Alter the game so that a human who wins the game can click the OK button and
   play another round.

The Moral of the Exercise:
The Controller implements the game's protocol/algorithm.
The View displays what is calculated.

Think about how state diagrams help us do "agile programming".
