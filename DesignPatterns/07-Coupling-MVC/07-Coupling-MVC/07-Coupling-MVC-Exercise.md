# Exercise: Coupling and The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

## Tasks

Open the `07-Coupling-MVC-Deal` VS Solution.

Write the missing `Main` method in `Program.cs` so that the Solution matches 
Version 3 -- the MVC architecture. 

`MainForm` is both an input view and an output view,
and `ScoreForm` is an output view only.

Also supply the missing code in class `MainForm`.
