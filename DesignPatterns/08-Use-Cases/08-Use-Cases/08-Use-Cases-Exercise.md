# Exercise: Use Cases and Diagrammatic Realizations

## Tasks

### I. Write a use-case realization of this use of a calculator:

1. I press `42`;  I see  ` 42`  on the display.

2. I press `+`;   I see  `   `  on the display.

3. I press `3`;   I see  `  3`  on the display.

4. I press `=`;   I see  ` 45`  on the display.

5. I press `/`;   I see  `   `  on the display.

6. I press `2`;   I see  `  2`  on the display

7. I press `=`;   I see  `22.5`  on the display.

NOTE: The "user interface" has buttons for 0, 1, .., 9, +, -, *, /, =
and also a display panel that shows an int.

The internal hardware can have one or more registers that each holds an int.
It can also have an internal "ALU" that does arithmetic.

USE THESE entities as needed in your use-case realization.

### II. For these four objects, draw a communication diagram of Steps 1-4 for the use-case realization:

* Display (a Form with a label and buttons)

* DataReg  (an input register)

* Accumulator (a register)

* ALU (does arithmetic)

### III. Draw a class diagram that would generate the documented behavior by editing `calculator.classdiagram`.

(For now, don't insert delegates or interfaces.)

## Submission

Submit your diagram(s)/paper(s) and copy the folder containing this file to your 
local GitHub repository for the course, and then commit and push your modified
solutions to GitHub
(see the  
[course note on Git/GitHub](http://softwarearch.santoslab.org/01-tooling/index.html#git-github)).
